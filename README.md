# Controller Tools

This fork was created to fix the issue with Controllers connected via the Xbox Wireless Adapter not working:
This was done but probably not properly because I am not a developer. I am running this on Bazzite so I cannot verify that it works on a steam deck. Also due to limitations, all controllers connected via the adapter will just show up as Wireless Adatper. You can see the battery life but cannot tell which controller is which. 

Finally, this is a temporary fix until the main version (https://github.com/jfernandez/ControllerTools) can make this fix properly. I am not uploading to the store instead am providing the zip file.
